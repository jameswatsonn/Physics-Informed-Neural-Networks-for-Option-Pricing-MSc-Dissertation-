## 🎯 Project Overview
Developed a novel AI pricing engine using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the fundamental PDEs of option pricing models, enabling fast, accurate valuation of European options under both Black-Scholes and complex stochastic volatility (Heston) models.

### Key Achievements:
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved L2 relative error < 1×10⁻⁴ through extensive back-testing and optimization
- **Robust Architecture:** Engineered model to be resilient to market regime shifts via hard-coded financial mathematics in loss function
- **Production-Ready:** Designed for deployment in low-latency trading systems
- **Innovative Approach:** Eliminated dependency on vast historical data and frequent computational recalibration
